# Datasets

This directory is intended to store the raw datasets used in the project (e.g., KITTI, BDD100k).

**This directory is intentionally left empty in the Git repository to avoid storing large files.**

## Setup Instructions

Please download the required datasets and place them here according to the structure expected by the data preparation scripts.

Refer to the main `README.md` or the specific dataset configuration files (e.g., `data/kitti.yaml`) for download links and expected directory structures.
